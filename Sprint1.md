## What issues your team planned to address

The front-end team planned to address creating a landing page, an about the web app section, as well as creating sign in and login pages. They also planned to update the internal routing (our temporary, "mocked backend") and pre-templated UI-kit pages as necessary.

The backend team planned to implement a pre-existing third-party authentication system so that users could make an account. [todo: write your other plans if there were more]
